    "#### KeyWord\n",
    "- Bitcoin is an open source\n",
    "\n",
    "#### KeyQuestion\n",
    "- 비트코인은 오픈소스이다.\n",
    "- 사토시 나카모토가 초기버전의 implementation을 만들었다.\n",
    "- 이후 contributor가 증가하면서 최초의 implementation은 bitcoin core라는 이름으로 변경되었다.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### KeyReference\n",
    "- Bitcoin is an open source project and the source code is available under an open (MIT) license, free to download and use for any purpose. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Open source means more than simply free to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "- It also means that bitcoin is developed by an open commu‐ nity of volunteers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- At first, that community consisted of only Satoshi Nakamoto. By 2016, bitcoin’s source code had more than 400 contributors with about a dozen devel‐ opers working on the code almost full-time and several dozen more on a part-time basis. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Anyone can contribute to the code—including you!\n",
    "\n",
    "- When bitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto, the software was actually completed before the whitepaper reproduced in * **Appendix A** * was written. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Satoshi wanted to make sure it worked before writing about it. \n",
    "\n",
    "- That first implementation, then simply known as “Bitcoin” or “Satoshi client,” has been heavily modified and improved. \n",
    "\n",
    "- It has evolved into what is known as Bitcoin Core, to differentiate it from other compatible implementations. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Bitcoin Core is the reference implementation of the bitcoin system, meaning that it is the authoritative reference on how each part of the technology should be implemented. Bitcoin Core implements all aspects of bitcoin, including wallets, a transaction and block validation engine, and a full network node in the peer-to-peer bitcoin network.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **tip::** Even though Bitcoin Core includes a reference implementation of a wallet, this is not intended to be used as a production wallet for users or for applications. Application developers are advised to build wallets using modern standards such as BIP-39 and BIP-32 * **(see “Mnemonic Code Words (BIP-39)” on page 99 and “HD Wal‐ lets (BIP-32/BIP-44)” on page 96)** *. BIP stands for Bitcoin Improve‐ ment Proposal.\n",

    "- Bitcoin Core’s source code can be downloaded as a ZIP archive or by cloning the authoritative source repository from GitHub. \n",
    "- On the [GitHub bitcoin page](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin), select Download ZIP from the sidebar. \n",
    "- Alternatively, use the git command line to create a local copy of the source code on your system.\n",
    "- **tip** : \n",
    " - In many of the examples in this chapter we will be using the oper‐ ating system’s command-line interface (also known as a “shell”), accessed via a “terminal” application. \n",
    "  - The shell will display a prompt; you type a command; and the shell responds with some text and a new prompt for your next command. \n",
    "  - The prompt may look different on your system, but in the following examples it is denoted by a `$` symbol. \n",
    "  - In the examples, when you see text after a `$` symbol, don’t type the `$` symbol but type the command immedi‐ ately following it, then press Enter to execute the command. \n",
    "  - In the examples, the lines below each command are the operating system’s responses to that command. \n",
    "  - When you see the next `$` prefix, you’ll know it’s a new command and you should repeat the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In this example, we are using the git command to create a local copy (“clone”) of the source code:\n",

    "### Running a Bitcoin Core Node\n",
    "#### KeyWord\n",
    "#### KeyQuestion\n",
    "#### KeyReference\n",
    "\n",
    "- **bitcoin node란?**\n",
    " - Bitcoin’s peer-to-peer network is composed of network “nodes,” run mostly by volun‐ teers and some of the businesses that build bitcoin applications. \n",
    " - Those running bit‐ coin nodes have a direct and authoritative view of the bitcoin blockchain, with a local copy of all the transactions, independently validated by their own system. \n",
    " \n",
    "- **bitcoin node하는일**\n",
    " - By running a node, you don’t have to rely on any third party to validate a transaction.\n",
    " - Moreover, by running a bitcoin node you contribute to the bitcoin network by making it more robust.\n",
    "- **bitcoin node specification** \n",
    " - Running a node, however, requires a permanently connected system with enough resources to process all bitcoin transactions. \n",
    " - Depending on whether you choose to index all transactions and keep a full copy of the blockchain, you may also need a lot of disk space and RAM. As of late 2016, a full-index node needs 2 GB of RAM and 125 GB of disk space so that it has room to grow. \n",
    " - Bitcoin nodes also transmit and receive bitcoin transactions and blocks, consuming internet bandwidth. \n",
    " - If your inter‐ net connection is limited, has a low data cap, or is metered (charged by the gigabit), you should probably not run a bitcoin node on it, or run it in a way that constrains its bandwidth (see Example 3-2).\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "- **TIP :**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Bitcoin Core keeps a full copy of the blockchain by default, with every transaction that has ever occurred on the bitcoin network since its inception in 2009. \n",
    "\n",
    "- This dataset is dozens of gigabytes in size and is downloaded incrementally over several days or weeks, depending on the speed of your CPU and internet connection. \n",
    "- Bit‐ coin Core will not be able to process transactions or update account balances until the full blockchain dataset is downloaded. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Make sure you have enough disk space, bandwidth, and time to complete the initial synchronization. \n",
    "\n",
    "- You can configure Bitcoin Core to reduce the size of the blockchain by discarding old blocks (see Example 3-2), but it will still download the entire dataset before discarding data.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- ~~Despite these resource requirements, thousands of volunteers run bitcoin nodes.~~\n",
    "- **bitcoin node를 운영하는 또다른 방법**\n",
    " - Some are running on systems as simple as a Raspberry Pi (a `$`35 USD computer the size of a pack of cards). \n",
    " - Many volunteers also run bitcoin nodes on rented servers, usually some variant of Linux. \n",
    " - A Virtual Private Server (VPS) or Cloud Computing Server instance can be used to run a bitcoin node. Such servers can be rented for `$`25 to `$`50 USD per month from a variety of providers.\n",
    "- **Why would you want to run a node? Here are some of the most common reasons:**\n",
    "  - If you are developing bitcoin software and need to rely on a bitcoin node for pro‐ grammable (API) access to the network and blockchain.\n",
    "  - If you are building applications that must validate transactions according to bit‐ coin’s consensus rules. Typically, bitcoin software companies run several nodes.\n",
    "  -  If you want to support bitcoin. Running a node makes the network more robust and able to serve more wallets, more users, and more transactions.\n",
    "  - If you do not want to rely on any third party to process or validate your transac‐ tions.\n",
    "  - If you’re reading this book and interested in developing bitcoin software, you should be running your own node."

    "### Using Bitcoin Core’s Programmatic Interface\n",
    "- ~~The bitcoin-cli helper is very useful for exploring the Bitcoin Core API and testing functions.~~ \n",
    "- ~~But the whole point of an application programming interface is to access functions programmatically.~~ \n",
    "- ~~In this section we will demonstrate accessing Bitcoin Core from another program.~~\n",
    "- ~~Bitcoin Core’s API is a JSON-RPC interface.~~ \n",
    "- ~~JSON stands for JavaScript Object Nota‐ tion and it is a very convenient way to present data that both humans and programs can easily read.~~ \n",
    "- **RPC(Remote Procedure Call)**\n",
    "    - RPC stands for Remote Procedure Call, which means that we are call‐ ing procedures (functions) that are remote (on the Bitcoin Core node) via a network protocol. \n",
    "    - In this case, the network protocol is HTTP, or HTTPS (for encrypted con‐ nections).\n",
    "    - When we used the bitcoin-cli command to get help on a command, it showed us an example of using curl, the versatile command-line HTTP client to construct one of these JSON-RPC calls:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "        $ curl --user myusername --data-binary \n",
    "        '{\n",
    "            \"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \n",
    "            \"id\":\"curltest\",\n",
    "            \"method\": \"getinfo\", \n",

    "        }' \n",
    "        -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:8332/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    - This command shows that curl submits an HTTP request to the local host (127.0.0.1), connecting to the default bitcoin port (8332), and submitting a jsonrpc request for the getinfo method using text/plain encoding.\n",
    "    - If you’re implementing a JSON-RPC call in your own program, you can use a generic HTTP library to construct the call, similar to what is shown in the preceding curl example.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **python library를 사용하여보자**\n",
    "    - However, there are libraries in most every programming language that “wrap” the Bitcoin Core API in a way that makes this a lot simpler. \n",
    "    - We will use the python- bitcoinlib library to simplify API access. \n",
    "    - Remember, this requires you to have a running Bitcoin Core instance, which will be used to make JSON-RPC calls.\n",
    "    - The Python script in Example 3-3 makes a simple getinfo call and prints the block parameter from the data returned by Bitcoin Core.\n",
    "    - `Example 3-3. Running getinfo via Bitcoin Core’s JSON-RPC API`\n",

    "    print(info['blocks'])\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "    $ python rpc_example.py\n",
    "    394075\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- It tells us that our local Bitcoin Core node has 394075 blocks in its blockchain. \n",
    "- Not a spectacular result, but it demonstrates the basic use of the library as a simplified interface to Bitcoin Core’s JSON-RPC API.\n",
    "- Next, let’s use the getrawtransaction and decodetransaction calls to retrieve the details of Alice’s coffee payment. \n",
    "- In Example 3-4, we retrieve Alice’s transaction and list the transaction’s outputs. \n",
